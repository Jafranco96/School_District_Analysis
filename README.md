# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose

Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district, has been tasked with analyzing standardized test data to determine the prevalence of any performance trends. The school board would then use the results of her analysis as justification for future budget allocations. Her analysis should include a district summary, school summary, the top 5 performing schools by overall passing rate, the bottom 5 performing schools by overall passing rate, the average math score for each grade level for each school, the average reading score for each grade level from each school, and the scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type. Maria utilized a jupyter notebook in a Python environment to analyze the data and delivered her initial analysis to the school board.

Reviewing her analysis, the school board has informed Maria that her raw data potentially includes altered and false data. Specifically, the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth grades seemed to have been manipulated. The school board has asked for the analysis to be rerun but with the aforementioned grades replaced with NaNs. The rest of the data should stay intact as is. The school board also wants to identify how each deliverable was affected by the rerun. 

## Analysis Results 
With the rerun completed, Maria determined how each deliverable was impacted by null valuing the Thomas High School ninth grade scores. The comparisons are listed below:
